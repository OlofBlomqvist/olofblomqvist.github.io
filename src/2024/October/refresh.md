# Time for a refresh

The 'twnet.se' domain has been active since 2002 mainly providing email services. It is about time to make some changes and actually publish some content here as well! ðŸŽ‰ 

This new website replaces the old placeholder page with a short introduction about me, acting as some sort of self-hosted CV. It is also going to be a place where I can write down thing I find interesting should I feel like doing so publicly instead of saving braindump-241028.md files all over the place on my local machine(s).
